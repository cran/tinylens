Description: Provides utilities to create and use lenses to simplify data
    manipulation. Lenses are composable getter/setter pairs that provide a
    functional approach to manipulating deeply nested data structures, e.g.,
    elements within list columns in data frames. The implementation is based on
    the earlier 'lenses' R package <https://github.com/cfhammill/lenses>,
    which was inspired by the Haskell 'lens' package by Kmett (2012)
    <https://github.com/ekmett/lens>, one of the most widely referenced
    implementations of lenses. For additional background and history on the
    theory of lenses, see the 'lens' package wiki:
    <https://github.com/ekmett/lens/wiki/History-of-Lenses>.
